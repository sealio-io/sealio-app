	<h3>Coding</h3>
	<p>In my free time I enjoy creating applications, games, or websites using code. The reason I love coding so much is because I find it fun figuring things out and learning about the concept of computer science. Though learning a new language or framework may be boring and un-motivating. Getting to the development stage of things is what I truly enjoy.</p>

	<h3>Anime</h3>
	<p>I love anime that involves a lot of fighting. Typically one where the main character is over powered and just wrecks everyone. When I was younger I was always in love with the Marvel and DC universe and still am today. But anime has provided me with a lot more fighting shows.</p>

	<h3>Gaming</h3>
	<p>Gaming has been a huge part of my life since pre-school. Though gaming has damaged my early academic career I still think it's safe to say that it's allowed me to decide on what I wanted to become when I got older. Gaming has thought me how to do a lot of things, much of it indirective. But a lot of it special. Such as creating my minecraft server via my IP address and learning how to pirate and use programs...shhh don't call the cops on me please.</p>
